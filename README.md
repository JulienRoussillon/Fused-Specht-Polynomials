# Fused-Specht-Polynomials

This repository aims to implement numerically a combinatorial formula for a novel class of polynomials called Fused Specht polynomials that I introduced with Augustin Lafay and Eveliina Peltola in https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09798.

These polynomials generalize the celebrated Specht polynomials, introduced in the first half of the XXth century to describe irreducible representations of the symmetric group.
