# Fused-Specht-Polynomials

This repository aims to implement numerically a combinatorial formula for a novel class of polynomials called Fused Specht polynomials that Augustin Lafay, Eveliina Peltola and myself introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09798.

These polynomials generalize the celebrated Specht polynomials, introduced in the first half of the XXth century to describe irreducible representations of the symmetric group. In fact, we utilize them to construct irreducible representations of fused symmetric groups in the space of polynomials. The main motivation to introduce these objects is that they describe a basis in the space of conformal blocks with arbitrary degenerate fields at c=1 in two-dimensional conformal field theories.
