# Fused-Specht-Polynomials

This repository aims to implement numerically a combinatorial formula for a novel class of polynomials called Fused Specht polynomials. Those polynomials were introduced by Augustin Lafay, Eveliina Peltola and myself introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09798.

The Fused Specht polynomials generalize the celebrated Specht polynomials, which were introduced in the first half of the 20th century to describe irreducible representations of the symmetric group. In our work, we use Fused Specht polynomials to construct irreducible representations of fused symmetric groups in the space of polynomials. Most importantly, the primary motivation for introducing these objects is that they describe a basis in the space of conformal blocks with arbitrary degenerate fields at c=1 in two-dimensional conformal field theories.
